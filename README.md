# Test API endpoints

This is just an app that I use to provide fake data enpoints to other apps while I develop them.

## Endpoints
- `GET` `/v1/people` - A list of people
- `GET` `/v1/person/:id` - get one person by ID
- `POST` `/v1/person` - create new person
- `DELETE` `/v1/person/:id` - delete person
- `GET` `/status/ready` - Readiness check
- `GET` `/status/live` - Liveliness check
